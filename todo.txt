TO DO:

* sort out string building for room/item/door/etc names that begin with vowels
* add items
* add opening + closing doors
* tests? learn about Python testing and make that work
* play with Pyparsing and see if it can help

LATER

* sort out an actual plot of some kind
* fancy stuff like using objects for things (eg: having a doorway blocked with ivy and using garden shears to clear it?)
* NPCs
* health and fighting?
* food and hunger?
* a help system?

DONE

* add looking at/through doors depending on whether they are closed
* sort out setting and getting of current room to make it less clumsy
* * I think I see a way to do this, as follows:
* * * First, set the starter room as a variable - not just its name
* * * This means I can continue to set current_room to the object itself and not the .name attribut
* * * When we move rooms, I can use find_room to set current_room to the object rather than its name
* * * This is because I'm using names and not object refs to do the exits
* * * Is this worth changing? It might be
* * * Will it continue to be worth changing if I do this some other way than coding the individual objects in by hand?
* * * That I don't know
* * * In fact there's a very good reason not to do that, which is that the variable has to be declared before I set it somewhere
* * * Which means that all the dominos will fall over if I try to do interlocking object references inside objects
* * * So let's keep find_room, but make current_room and previous_room be the object
* notes on looking in a direction
* * I now have a guaranteed sensible direction returned from is_move, yay
* * the next job is to check which door we want
* * the job after that is to generate a sensible error if the door does not exist
* * then we check whether the door is open
* * if the door is closed, we throw out the description of the door
* * if the door is open, we throw out the short description of the room beyond
* sort out parsing so that things like "look north" work in a slightly better way
* add moving from room to room
* rooms! they are rooms! with descriptions!
* there are doors
* you can break the while loop by quitting
* you can look at the current room
* the room tracks where you were last so it can show different stuff if you've moved
* there is the ghost of functionality for moving
* also the ghost of functionality for looking at/through doors
* there is now a function that will match bits of strings (see to do re: parsing)
* add three more rooms to make a basic five-room game
* separate game logic into separate module
* separate text-parsing and string-building out into separate modules for readability and maintainability
