TO DO:

* sort out parsing so that things like "look north" work in a slightly better way
* sort out string building for room/item/door/etc names that begin with vowels
* add items
* add looking at/through doors depending on whether they are closed
* add opening + closing doors
* add moving from room to room
* tests? learn about Python testing and make that work
* separate text-parsing and string-building out into separate modules for readability and maintainability

LATER

* sort out an actual plot of some kind
* fancy stuff like using objects for things (eg: having a doorway blocked with ivy and using garden shears to clear it?)
* NPCs
* health and fighting?
* food and hunger?
* a help system?

DONE

* rooms! they are rooms! with descriptions!
* there are doors
* you can break the while loop by quitting
* you can look at the current room
* the room tracks where you were last so it can show different stuff if you've moved
* there is the ghost of functionality for moving
* also the ghost of functionality for looking at/through doors
* there is now a function that will match bits of strings (see to do re: parsing)
* add three more rooms to make a basic five-room game
